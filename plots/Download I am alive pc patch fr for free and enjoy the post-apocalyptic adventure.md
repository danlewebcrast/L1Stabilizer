The game features a realistic and dark atmosphere, where the player has to use stealth, combat, and exploration to survive. The game also has a stamina system that limits the player's actions, such as climbing, running, or fighting. The player has to manage their stamina carefully and find items to restore it, such as water bottles or food cans. The game also has a moral system that affects the player's interactions with other survivors. The player can choose to help, ignore, or harm them, but each choice has consequences.
 
I Am Alive received mixed reviews from critics and players. Some praised the game's atmosphere, story, and survival elements, while others criticized the game's graphics, controls, and technical issues. The game sold over one million copies worldwide as of 2013. A sequel was rumored to be in development, but no official announcement has been made.

The game's story is divided into 21 episodes, each with a different objective and location. The player has to navigate through the ruins of Haventon, avoiding environmental hazards such as dust storms, fires, or collapsed buildings. The player also has to deal with hostile survivors, who can be armed with guns, knives, or machetes. The player can use a variety of weapons, such as a handgun, a bow, or a machete, but ammo and arrows are scarce and have to be used wisely. The player can also use intimidation tactics, such as pointing an empty gun or bluffing, to scare off enemies or make them surrender.

The game's moral system affects the player's reputation and karma. The player can encounter different types of survivors, such as victims, aggressors, or neutrals. The player can choose to help the victims by giving them items or saving them from danger, ignore them, or harm them by stealing their items or killing them. Helping the victims increases the player's reputation and karma, while harming them decreases it. The player's reputation and karma affect the reactions of other survivors and the game's ending.
 
The game has four possible endings, depending on the player's actions and choices throughout the game. The endings are:
 
- Good Ending: The player finds his wife and daughter alive and reunites with them.
- Bad Ending: The player finds his wife and daughter dead and commits suicide.
- Neutral Ending: The player finds his wife and daughter alive but they reject him.
- Secret Ending: The player finds out that his wife and daughter never existed and that he was suffering from a mental breakdown.
