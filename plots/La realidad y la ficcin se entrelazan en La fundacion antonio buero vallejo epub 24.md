# La FundaciÃ³n: A Tragic Play by Antonio Buero Vallejo
 
La FundaciÃ³n (The Foundation) is a play by the Spanish playwright Antonio Buero Vallejo (1916-2000), written between 1972 and 1973 and first performed in 1974. It is considered one of his masterpieces, along with El tragaluz (The Basement Window) and Historia de una escalera (Story of a Stairway).
 
The play is set in a single room, where six men live and work under the auspices of The Foundation, a mysterious institution that supposedly funds their research projects. However, as the play progresses, the reality of their situation is gradually revealed: they are actually political prisoners, tortured and brainwashed by a totalitarian regime. The room is a cell, the window is a screen, and the music is a device to manipulate their emotions. Only one of them, TomÃ¡s, has created an elaborate fantasy world to cope with his suffering, while the others try to make him face the truth.

La FundaciÃ³n explores themes such as freedom and oppression, truth and illusion, morality and violence, and the power of art and imagination. It also reflects on the historical and political context of Spain under Franco's dictatorship, and the role of intellectuals and artists in resisting authoritarianism. The play has been compared to La vida es sueÃ±o (Life's a Dream) by Pedro CalderÃ³n de la Barca, a classic of Spanish Golden Age drama that also deals with the nature of reality and human destiny.
 
La FundaciÃ³n is available in several editions and formats, including an epub version that can be downloaded for free from the Internet Archive[^1^]. It has also been translated into English by John Graham Jones as The Foundation[^2^], and adapted for radio, television and film.
  
La FundaciÃ³n is not only a gripping drama, but also a profound reflection on the human condition, the role of art and imagination, and the ethical and political challenges of living under oppression. Buero Vallejo uses various techniques to create a contrast between reality and fiction, such as the changing scenery, the music, the lighting, and the dialogue. He also employs symbols and metaphors, such as the window, the bed, the bar, and the rat, to convey different aspects of the characters' situation and psychology.
 
The play has been widely praised by critics and audiences alike, both for its dramatic intensity and its philosophical depth. It has been considered one of Buero Vallejo's masterpieces, along with El tragaluz (The Basement Window) and Historia de una escalera (Story of a Stairway), which also explore the themes of illusion and reality, freedom and oppression, and individual and collective responsibility. La FundaciÃ³n has been described as a "fable", a "parable", a "tragedy", and a "metaphysical drama". It has also been compared to La vida es sueÃ±o (Life's a Dream) by Pedro CalderÃ³n de la Barca, a classic of Spanish Golden Age drama that also deals with the nature of reality and human destiny[^2^].
