Interchange Third Edition Student's Book 1 is a textbook for adult and young adult learners of English from the beginning to the high-intermediate level. It is part of a four-level series that aims to improve students' communicative skills and develop their fluency. The book was written by Jack C. Richards, Jonathan Hull, and Susan Proctor, and published by Cambridge University Press in 2005.
 
The book consists of 16 units, each with a different topic and a set of goals. The units follow a consistent structure that includes a snapshot (an introductory dialogue or text), a conversation (a listening and speaking activity), a grammar focus (a presentation and practice of a grammatical point), a word power (a vocabulary development activity), a pronunciation (a focus on a specific sound or feature), an interchange activity (a pair or group work task), a listening (a comprehension activity), a reading (a text with exercises), and a writing (a guided writing task). The book also has four progress checks, four self-study units, and two review quizzes.
