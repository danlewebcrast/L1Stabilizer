# How to Activate Multisim 12 with a 20 Character Code
 
Multisim 12 is a powerful and easy-to-use circuit design and simulation software from National Instruments. It allows you to create, test, and optimize circuits for various applications. However, to use Multisim 12, you need to activate it with a valid license.
 
One way to activate Multisim 12 is to use a 20 character activation code that you can obtain from National Instruments or from an authorized reseller. This code is a unique combination of letters and numbers that identifies your product and grants you access to its features. To activate Multisim 12 with a 20 character code, follow these steps:
