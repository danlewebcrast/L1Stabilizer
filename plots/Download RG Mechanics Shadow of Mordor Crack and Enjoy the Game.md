Now that you have installed RG Mechanics Shadow of Mordor crack, you might be wondering how to play the game and get the most out of it. Here are some gameplay tips that will help you become a master of Middle-earth:

- Get intel. Intel allows you to identify specific strengths and weaknesses of the captains and warchiefs that you encounter. You can get intel by interrogating worms (green highlighted uruks), finding intel items (blue icons on the map), or completing side missions. Knowing your enemy's traits will help you plan your strategy and exploit their vulnerabilities.
- Kill bodyguards. Before taking on a warchief, it is advisable to kill or brand their bodyguards first. This will weaken their power and influence, and make your fight easier. You can find out who are the bodyguards of a warchief by using intel or looking at the army screen (press Tab).
- Play the story. The story missions will unlock new abilities and regions for you, as well as advance the plot and introduce new characters. You can also earn XP and Mirian (the currency of the game) by completing story missions. The story missions are marked by yellow icons on the map.
- Just run. Sometimes, the best option is to retreat and regroup. If you are overwhelmed by enemies or facing a tough captain/warchief, you can use your speed and agility to escape. You can also use your wraith abilities to distract or stun your pursuers. Running away is not a sign of cowardice, but a smart tactic.
- Don't retry endlessly. If you fail a mission or die at the hands of an enemy, don't get frustrated and keep trying the same thing over and over again. The game has a dynamic Nemesis system that changes the world according to your actions and outcomes. You might find new opportunities or challenges if you explore other areas or do other missions first.
- Let some orcs advance. You don't have to kill every orc that crosses your path. In fact, sometimes it is beneficial to let some orcs survive and advance in rank. This will create more rivalries and power struggles among them, which you can exploit to your advantage. You can also use death threats to increase the difficulty and reward of killing a captain/warchief.
- Draw them out. Some captains/warchiefs are cowardly or cautious, and will not show up unless you lure them out. You can do this by fulfilling their specific criteria, such as killing their supporters, causing chaos, or challenging them directly. You can find out how to draw out a captain/warchief by using intel or looking at their profile on the army screen.

These are just some of the tips that will help you enjoy RG Mechanics Shadow of Mordor crack. There are many more things to discover and do in this game, such as collecting artifacts, hunting beasts, completing challenges, and dominating enemies. The game offers a lot of freedom and variety for you to create your own story and legend in Middle-earth.
