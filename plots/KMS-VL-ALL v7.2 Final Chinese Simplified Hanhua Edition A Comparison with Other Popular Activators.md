There are some benefits of using KMS activation for your Windows and Office products. Some of them are:
 
- KMS clients do not need to access the Internet or the phone to activate the product, only network access to the KMS host is required[^3^]. This can save bandwidth and avoid potential activation errors due to network issues.
- KMS clients are activated for 180 days and attempt to renew their activation every 7 days[^2^]. This means that they can stay activated as long as they can contact the KMS host periodically. If the KMS host becomes unavailable, the clients have a grace period of up to 30 days to reconnect and renew their activation.
- KMS hosts can support an unlimited number of KMS clients[^2^]. This can simplify the management and deployment of volume activation for large organizations with many computers.
- KMS hosts can activate both Windows and Office products with a single key[^2^]. This can reduce the number of keys that need to be obtained and installed on the KMS host.

However, there are also some limitations and drawbacks of using KMS activation. Some of them are:

- KMS clients must meet a minimum activation threshold before they can be activated. For Windows clients, the threshold is 25, and for Windows servers and Office products, the threshold is 5[^2^]. This means that small networks with fewer computers may not be able to use KMS activation.
- KMS clients must be able to contact the KMS host at least once every 180 days to stay activated[^2^]. This means that computers that are offline or isolated from the network for a long time may lose their activation and enter a reduced functionality mode.
- KMS hosts must be updated regularly to support new versions and editions of Windows and Office products[^2^]. This means that administrators need to monitor and apply the latest updates for the KMS host to ensure that it can activate all supported products.
- KMS activation is intended for educational and testing purposes only, and users should respect the terms and conditions of Microsoft and purchase genuine licenses for their products. Using KMS activation without a valid license may violate the software licensing agreement and result in legal consequences.
