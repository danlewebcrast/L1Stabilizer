There are many BIOS password reset tools available online, but some of them may contain malware or viruses. Therefore, we suggest that you use a reputable and trusted tool such as [BIOS-PW.org](https://bios-pw.org/). This is a free and safe website that can generate BIOS master passwords for various laptop brands and models.
 
To use this tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Turn off your HP EliteBook 8560p and disconnect it from any power source.
2. Turn it on again and press <kbd>F10</kbd> repeatedly to enter the BIOS setup menu.
3. You will see a screen asking for a password. If you enter the wrong password three times, you will see a message saying "System Disabled" followed by a code. Write down this code or take a picture of it.
4. Go to [BIOS-PW.org](https://bios-pw.org/) on another device and enter the code in the box. Click on "Get password" and you will see a list of possible master passwords.
5. Try each of these passwords until you find the one that works for your laptop. Enter it in the BIOS setup menu and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
6. You should now be able to access your system settings and boot options. You can also change or remove the BIOS password from here if you want.

## Method 2: Use a Hardware Reset
 
Another way to crack BIOS password on HP EliteBook 8560p is to use a hardware reset. This involves opening up your laptop and removing the CMOS battery that powers the BIOS memory. This will erase the BIOS settings and password, allowing you to access your system settings and boot options.
 
However, this method is more risky and complicated than using a software tool. You will need some tools such as a screwdriver, a pair of tweezers, and an anti-static wrist strap. You will also need to be careful not to damage any components or wires inside your laptop. Therefore, we recommend that you only try this method if you are confident in your skills and have no other option.
 
To use this method, follow these steps:

1. Turn off your HP EliteBook 8560p and disconnect it from any power source. Remove the battery from the back of the laptop.
2. Use a screwdriver to remove the screws that secure the bottom cover of the laptop. Carefully lift off the cover and set it aside.
3. Locate the CMOS battery on the motherboard. It is a small round silver battery that looks like a coin. Use a pair of tweezers to gently pry it out of its socket.
4. Wait for about 15 minutes to let the BIOS memory clear. Then reinsert the CMOS battery into its socket.
5. Replace the bottom cover of the laptop and secure it with the screws. Reinsert the battery and connect it 8cf37b1e13
