Biochemical engineering is a field of study that combines principles of chemical engineering and biological engineering to design, construct, and optimize processes that involve biological organisms or molecules. Biochemical engineers work in various industries such as biotechnology, biofuels, pharmaceuticals, water purification, and food, where they develop products and technologies that benefit society and human well-being.

One of the books that provides a thorough introduction to biochemical engineering is *Introduction to Biochemical Engineering* by D G Rao. This book covers the fundamental concepts and applications of biochemical engineering, such as enzyme kinetics, microbial growth, bioreactor design, fermentation, downstream processing, bioseparation, and bioprocess control. The book also includes numerous examples, problems, and case studies to illustrate the theory and practice of biochemical engineering.
 
The second edition of this book was published by Tata McGraw Hill in 2010 and has 480 pages. The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students of biochemical engineering, as well as professionals and researchers in the field. The book is available in PDF format for free download from various online sources[^1^] [^2^] [^3^] [^4^]. However, readers are advised to check the validity and quality of these sources before downloading the book.
 
Biochemical engineering is a fascinating and dynamic field that offers many opportunities and challenges for those who are interested in it. By reading *Introduction to Biochemical Engineering* by D G Rao, one can gain a solid foundation and understanding of this field and its applications.
  
One of the topics that the book *Introduction to Biochemical Engineering* by D G Rao covers in detail is bioreactor design. A bioreactor is a device or system that provides a suitable environment for biological reactions to take place. Bioreactors are used for various purposes, such as producing biofuels, biopharmaceuticals, enzymes, vaccines, and other valuable products. The book explains the different types and configurations of bioreactors, such as batch, continuous, fed-batch, stirred-tank, airlift, fluidized-bed, and membrane bioreactors. The book also discusses the factors that affect the performance and operation of bioreactors, such as mass transfer, heat transfer, mixing, aeration, sterilization, and scale-up.
 
Another topic that the book *Introduction to Biochemical Engineering* by D G Rao covers in detail is downstream processing. Downstream processing is the process of recovering and purifying the desired product from the bioreactor broth. Downstream processing is often the most expensive and complex part of a bioprocess, as it involves multiple steps and techniques, such as filtration, centrifugation, extraction, precipitation, chromatography, electrophoresis, crystallization, and drying. The book explains the principles and applications of these techniques and how to optimize them for different products and processes.
