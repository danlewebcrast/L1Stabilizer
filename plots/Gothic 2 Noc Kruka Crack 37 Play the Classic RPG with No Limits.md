Gothic 2 Noc Kruka (Night of the Raven) is a role-playing game developed by Piranha Bytes and released in 2003. It is an official expansion to Gothic 2, one of the most popular RPGs of 2002. The expansion adds a new story chapter, new locations, new items, new spells, new abilities and new monsters to the original game. It also increases the difficulty level and improves the graphics and sound effects.
 
The expansion is set in the same world as Gothic 2, but it focuses on a different plot. The player can choose to join one of three factions: the Water Mages, the Bandits or the Pirates. Each faction has its own quests, secrets and rewards. The main goal of the expansion is to stop a ruthless pirate named Raven, who wants to steal an ancient artifact called the Claw of Beliar. The Claw is a powerful weapon that can grant its wielder godlike powers.

Gothic 2 Noc Kruka is widely regarded as one of the best RPG expansions ever made. It offers a rich and immersive game world, a complex and nonlinear story, a dynamic and realistic combat system, a deep and varied character development and a high replay value. The expansion also challenges the player with tough enemies, scarce resources, harsh environments and moral dilemmas. Gothic 2 Noc Kruka is not a game for casual players, but for those who love a true RPG experience.
  
One of the most distinctive features of Gothic 2 Noc Kruka is the freedom of choice that the player has. The game does not force the player to follow a linear path, but allows them to explore the world at their own pace and make their own decisions. The player can interact with hundreds of NPCs, each with their own personality, background and attitude. The player can also influence the outcome of the story and the fate of the characters by their actions and words. The game has multiple endings, depending on the player's choices and alignment.
