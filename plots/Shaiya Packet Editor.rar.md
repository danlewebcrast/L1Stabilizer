## Downloading and Installing Shaiya Packet Editor
 
Shaiya Packet Editor is a DLL file that needs to be injected into the game process using an injector program. You can download the DLL file and the injector from [this forum post\[^2^\]](https://www.elitepvpers.com/forum/shaiya-hacks-bots-cheats-exploits/345629-release-shaiya-packet-editor.html). The post also contains the source code of the DLL file, which is written in C++ 20. You can compile it yourself using Visual Studio 2019 if you want to modify it or check it for malware.
 
To install Shaiya Packet Editor, follow these steps:
 
1. Extract the RAR archive that contains the DLL file and the injector.
2. Run the Shaiya launcher and wait for it to update.
3. Run the injector.exe file as administrator.
4. Start the game and log in to your account.

If everything goes well, you should see a message box saying "Shaiya Packet Editor injected successfully" and a console window showing the packets that are sent and received by the game client.
 
## Using Shaiya Packet Editor
 
Shaiya Packet Editor works by detouring the internal function of the game that encrypts and sends packets. It then displays the packets in a console window and allows you to modify them before they are sent. You can also send your own custom packets using keyboard commands.
 
To use Shaiya Packet Editor, follow these steps:

1. Open the console window by pressing F12. You should see a list of packets with their hexadecimal values and lengths.
2. To filter out specific packets, press F11 and enter a packet ID or a range of IDs. For example, if you want to see only packets with ID 0x01, enter "01". If you want to see packets with ID from 0x01 to 0x0F, enter "01-0F". Press F11 again to disable filtering.
3. To modify a packet before it is sent, press F10 and enter a packet ID or a range of IDs. For example, if you want to modify packets with ID 0x01, enter "01". If you want to modify packets with ID from 0x01 to 0x0F, enter "01-0F". Press F10 again to disable modifying.
4. When you enable modifying mode, you will see a prompt asking you to enter the new values for each byte of the packet. For example, if you want to change the first byte of packet 0x01 from 0x01 to 0xFF, enter "FF". If you want to keep the original value, press Enter. If you want to cancel modifying mode, press Esc.
5. To send your own custom packet, press F9 and enter the packet ID followed by the values for each byte. For example, if you want to send packet 0x01 with values 0xFF 0x00 0x00 0x00, enter "01 FF 00 00 00". Press Enter to send the packet or Esc to cancel.
