## What is TMPGEnc MPEG Smart Renderer 6?
 
TMPGEnc MPEG Smart Renderer 6 is a video editing software that specializes in cutting videos. It supports various formats, such as MPEG-2, H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC, AVI (uncompressed, Motion JPEG, Cineform), VP9 and more. It also supports previewing, editing and outputting in the HDR (High Dynamic Range) color space, which allows you to import and export footage with vivid colors and contrast.
 
One of the main features of TMPGEnc MPEG Smart Renderer 6 is the "Smart Rendering" function. Smart rendering has the ability to analyze a video file and re-encode only the parts that have been changed, such as cut/split/join points and sections where transitions or other effects have been added. Parts of the video that have not changed are not re-encoded. This way, you can reduce the time for output without losing the original quality other than the altered parts.
 
TMPGEnc MPEG Smart Renderer 6 also includes Blu-ray BDAV authoring and the Commercial Candidate Detector function, for a complete high speed experience of cutting, editing and output.
