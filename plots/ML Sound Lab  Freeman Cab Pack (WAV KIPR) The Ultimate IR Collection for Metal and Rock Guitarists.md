The Freeman Cab Pack comes with 5 brightness variations for each of the 8 microphones used to capture the cabinet: Shureâ¢ SM57, Shureâ¢ SM7B, Shureâ¢ SM58, Royerâ¢ R121, Sennheiserâ¢ e906, Sennheiserâ¢ MD421, Beyerdynamicâ¢ M160, and Neumannâ¢ KM184. It also includes 6 real life multi-mic mixes that blend different microphones for a balanced and realistic tone. The Cab Pack is provided in multiple .wav file formats: 500ms 16/24bit 44.1kHz, 48kHz and 96kHz sample rates and in separate 200ms formats for the Fractal Audio Axe-Fx III, Line 6 Helix and Kemper Profiling Amplifier. All files come both in raw format and a minimum phase transformed (MPT) format that is phase aligned with most modelersâ user cabinets.
 
The Freeman Cab Pack offers a variety of tones and textures for different genres and styles of music. The Friedmanâ¢ Vintage 4x12 cabinet is known for its punchy and aggressive sound, with a tight low end and a smooth high end. The Celestionâ¢ Greenback speakers add warmth and midrange character, while the Celestionâ¢ Vintage 30 speakers provide more clarity and definition. The combination of these speakers creates a balanced and versatile cabinet that can handle anything from clean to high gain tones.
